            "With heavy heart I take pen in hand to express my utter disappointment in this Casio Men's watch.  From the picture which accompanies the description, the watch appears to be a unique piece of quality men's jewelry, a statement of personal individuality that defines a man who lives life on his own terms.  However, do not be seduced by the misleading photo.  One would expect much more from a watch offered at the listed price and emblazoned with the name Casio.  The quality materials, sturdy design, and superb craftsmanship that has come to define Casio over the years and place it on the cutting edge of both technology and fashion can simply not be found in this shabby watch.  It offers nothing at all to the man who demands the very best in his timepieces and hardly fits the bare necessities that ordinarily one finds in a fine Casio.  As was stated before, the picture, description, and price is indeed seductive but reality is more than harsh, it is actually unrelenting in its brutality when the theft-proof packaging is at long last torn open in overwhelming anticipation.  Then, when the watch is met by the desk lamp of one's study, it is as if the oxygen is suddenly sucked from the room.  Initially, the reaction is that there is some sort of terrible mistake until it becomes clear that the most accurate part of the cruel deception perpetrated here is clearly found in the price of this sad item.  I was mislead by both the Casio brand as well as that price.  I believed Casio's reputation would not be put at risk and that a true bargain was available.  I trusted that with the name, quality was most certainly bound to follow and this watch would become a treasured part of my Casio collection.  It did not happen that way and the deception has left me with a rubber and plastic watch unworthy of even the wrist of the most uneducated peasant or Timex enthusiast.  Perhaps this is a new sale tactic, an effort to attract a quite different clientele to a once respected watchmaking tradition.  So be it.  Yet another legacy of excellence passes into the mist of history."

I changed the battery but the connection somewhere is shaky and it's time to replace this.  I had expected it to last much longer.  Under the circumstances I'll generously give this a 3.",
            "I have no connection whatsoever with Casio or any other watch manufacturer, distributor or seller.  I just love watches.  Bought this one two months ago and, like all my other Casio watches, it works perfectly well, absorbs no water when I'm washing my hands and, some time in the future when its battery dies, I'll take it to my little local watch guy and have the battery replaced, no big deal.  I've seen all kinds of complaints about watches on this board, but you'll never get me to disbelieve that Casio watches are one of the greatest values for money on this planet.  Purity of design, reliability, price, you just can't beat them.  I've never in twenty years had one up and die.  They just need a new battery and then keep chugging right along.  If somebody comments on my watch and admires it, I just take it off and give it to them.  Gives ME an opportunity to buy a new and different Casio!"

            "Wow. I was so excited to see a 'SmartWatch' made by Casio!! I've loved Casio watches since my Dad bought me my first one (a Casio G-Shock Digital Watch) back in 1981 when I was in the 7th Grade in Middle a School. It looked SO COOL and my fellow Classmates also loved it! I loved watches so much, that I wore my Casio on one wrist while wearing my Pac-Man Watch on my other. I was the most popular kid in School because of my academic prowess and my Double-Watch-Wearing tendencies. Ah.. Happy times, they were. So many memories. Some great, some not so much. lol Anyway, Casio is a WONDERFUL Watch-Making Company. Excellent quality, Durable, Water-Resistant Watches that MORE THAN 'Take a licking and keep on Ticking'. These watches endure the roughest treatment (my friends and I were VERY wild & rough when playing outdoors). I'm giving this 'SmartWatch' 3-Stars, because although it's got to be just as high in quality as the many Casio G-Shock Watches that I've owned and loved in the past, this 'SmartWatch' is VERY LIMITED in compatibility with Smartphones. To my utter disgrace, they (Casio) seem to be following the demographically-blinded trend of so many other companies by catering to devices made by a company whose 'Popularity' was garnered ONLY via design aesthetics and elite pricing, EXCLUSIVELY, and NOT making their 'SmartWatch' compatible with SmartPhones in general. That DOES NOT say 'Smart' AT ALL, by ANY stretch of the imagination. For this, I denounce my previous loyalty to Casio. This decision of their part is abhorrent, to say the least. \ud83d\ude12<br /><br />Dear Casio: There are even SMARTER phones out here than those that you've decided to cater to. Phones that have MUCH MORE SmartPhone functionality that could be taken advantage of both by your Watches and the consumers who buy them. Oh, well.. It's your loss. Wise up soon, old friend. Seriously.\ud83d\ude12",
            "I can't believe I'm saying this but I actually like the Armitron digital watches over the casios.  I can usually buy 4 or 5 Armitron watches for the price of one casio watch.  They hold up extremely well, are provide more comfort and a more pleasing design.  When I received my casio watch, I had to get used to the small numbers.  Plus it's hard to see the time under certain lighting conditions.  I'm not saying this is a bad watch but just can't believe I can get a much cheaper watch that is more appealing in almost every way.  But if you like the name Casio, buy it.  That's why many buy Lexus and BMWs.  I know there are a lot of great reviews for this watch but I just like other brands.  For instance I have a shock watch by Timex.  It is so much cooler looking and comfortable.  Usually you get what you pay for.  This may be one of those rare exceptions to the contrary.",
            "The Watch is great for the price.  It looks cool, runs accurate and is durable.  I'm not a fan of the strap, it is stiff close to the face and sits funny on my wrist.  But overall, not bad at all."

Some great, some not so much. lol Anyway, Casio is a WONDERFUL Watch-Making Company. Excellent quality, Durable, Water-Resistant Watches that MORE THAN 'Take a licking and keep on Ticking'. These watches endure the roughest treatment (my friends and I were VERY wild & rough when playing outdoors). I'm giving this 'SmartWatch' 3-Stars, because although it's got to be just as high in quality as the many Casio G-Shock Watches that I've owned and loved in the past, this 'SmartWatch' is VERY LIMITED in compatibility with Smartphones. To my utter disgrace, they (Casio) seem to be following the demographically-blinded trend of so many other companies by catering to devices made by a company whose 'Popularity' was garnered ONLY via design aesthetics and elite pricing, EXCLUSIVELY, and NOT making their 'SmartWatch' compatible with SmartPhones in general. That DOES NOT say 'Smart' AT ALL, by ANY stretch of the imagination. For this, I denounce my previous loyalty to Casio. This decision of their part is abhorrent, to say the least. \ud83d\ude12<br /><br />Dear Casio: There are even SMARTER phones out here than those that you've decided to cater to. Phones that have MUCH MORE SmartPhone functionality that could be taken advantage of both by your Watches and the consumers who buy them. Oh, well.. It's your loss. Wise up soon, old friend.

            "I really like the look of the watch. I was hesitant at first about purchasing it after reading a couple of reviews stating that it has a low quality feel to it. It seems sturdy to me. The only problem I have, which is minor, is that I don't like the feel of it on my skin after a long day of wearing it once I shut down for the evening. Very simple to fix, don't fall asleep while keeping the watch on in my case."

            "I have no connection whatsoever with Casio or any other watch manufacturer, distributor or seller.  I just love watches.  Bought this one two months ago and, like all my other Casio watches, it works perfectly well, absorbs no water when I'm washing my hands and, some time in the future when its battery dies, I'll take it to my little local watch guy and have the battery replaced, no big deal.  I've seen all kinds of complaints about watches on this board, but you'll never get me to disbelieve that Casio watches are one of the greatest values for money on this planet.  Purity of design, reliability, price, you just can't beat them.  I've never in twenty years had one up and die.  They just need a new battery and then keep chugging right along.  If somebody comments on my watch and admires it, I just take it off and give it to them.  Gives ME an opportunity to buy a new and different Casio!"
